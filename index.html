            <b>8/25/23</b> - What I did this week of August that stood out was ballin' in the park (playing some basketball) when other came and we did a three v three. We played twice and I was on both losing teams because my teamates sold (gave the game away). Another thing was playing a game called Pokemon go and getting the two legendaries named Kyogre and Groudon in the same day. Lastly I saw my brother go to college for the first time. What I learned this week is about the safety rules in Intro to Engineering. We learned to safe and follow the rules. I also learned how to dribble better. On Thursday, we did a challenge were we had to use a half pipe and a marble with a cup. We had to get the marble in the cup without touching the marble, moving and using other half pipes by passing them on to other people so the marble could get in the cup. During the weekend I am probably going to play some video games, and doing the pokemon go go fest global on Saturday and Sunday.

            <b>9/1/23</b> - In this week of August and September, the engineering disicpline we learned was to be safe at all times and never play with the materiales. The project we started was we have to roll a baseball down a contraption so it hits a needle a pops a ballon. What we designed was a 2 rods holding the baseball when it goes down, something heavy would fly up in the air connected to a rope, hits a golf ball or something like a golf ball and lanches a nail and hits the ballon.

             <b>9/8/23</b> - In this week, it went well. I can't really do much stuff, yet, but one thing that I liked this week was seeing my Brother In-law's dog named MJ, I was playing with him and feed him, she's a German Shephard. Somethings that I learned this week was, how to do Inequalities in math. What the machine below will do is, a ramp rolls the ball down, hits a plank that launches another ball that hits a car,, with a needle that pops the ballon, that's a ballon. The most challenging part for me will probably the taping and measuring part.

             <b>9/22/23</b> - In this week, Monday we proceeded with the rude goldberg project, it failed successfully. The plan was the baseball was gonna hit a lever and laucn another ball to hit a cacr that has a needle that pops a ballon, the other ball did nothing but the baseball hit the car with hit the ballon and popped it. If we had just a bit more time, we could of made it better. In the week I am in now, I learned the affects of measruing and surface space, this is what we did. On Tuesday, we created a paper that is supposed to hold a lot of weight on some water for 5 minutes. The most weight held wins. Ours was a paper with walls and no roof holding 77.6 grams. It sank in atleast 16 seconds. On Wednesday, we created an E and measured the letter and created for another person. On Thursday, we sat and saw a presenaation. Today (Friday), we are doing what you are reading.

            <b>9/28/23</b> - In this week, I learned the components of a computer and where they are located. The parts of Computer Engineering that intrest me are the embedded systems because it is fun for me. This week disected computers to see parts. learn about those parts, and obeserve them. What I learned about computers is that every two years, the amount of transitors double, this is called Moore's laws. There is also a computer architecture that shows how a computer works. It has in input device, that goes into the central processing unit, which switches out with the memory unit, and goes into the output device. This weekend Im probably gonna play no bases baseball with my brother because I can't run and it wouldn't be fair, its a plastic ball and bat so its not really baseball. Also Im going to sleep.

            <b>10/6/23</b> - In this week we learned about Bioengineering. What it basically is about is the application of principles of biology and the tools of engineering to create usable, tangible, economically-viable products. We also made a hand thats supposed to pick up an empty water bottle. We made a hand with only two fingers and a thumb wich worked. If we had an extra day, we could of had the rubber bands not block the the hand so it would be better when we picked it up. This weekend I am probably gonna buy Mortal Kombat 1, the recent one, and pre-order assasin's creed. And no I am not going to homecoming

            <b>10/13/23</b> - In this week, we learned about the topic of Aerospace. What it basically is about is the flight of things in space, or on Earth, like the international space station, the ISS, or a airplane like the Boeing 747-400 Dreamlifter. The 4 forces of flying objects are trust, drag, lift and weight. We made a CAD about a bottle rocket that we are making, it is bellow. our Build or materiales, or BOM, intresting choice, is the link below. If there is one thing I like about class so far is we are able to use our own imagination to do stuff like challenges or just laughing to some random image of a shovel.

           <b>10/20/23</b> - In this week, we were still learning about Aerospace enignineering, but the end of last week, we went into our teams to design a bottle rocket. This week we started building it and ours didn't go as planned, but not everyone did good either, but the point is to have fun, and it was. Ours was unique because while it didn't fly foward, it did a loop in the air. All we did this week was design and build the rocket. If there was one thing I wanted to add was a parachute, to be unique. Below is a video of our rocket and the picture of it.

            <b>10/26/23</b> - In this week, we learned about enviromental engineering, about how these engineers help make water, air and the land better and safer for us. We did a project on how to make have black water, contaminated water, and turn it into white water, clean water. The picture is below, it turned out bad, because I didn't know exactly how to do it because but I tried with my partner, and it looked ok, the picture here is after the first try. I am going enjoy this weekend because we don't get another banking day on the next Monday from today, and I will go to my friends house on Saturday so I'll have something to do.

            <b>11/9/23</b> - In last week and this week we are learning about electrical engineering, it didn't not understand it well. What was intresting is the fact that lights that dim don't actually dim, in reality, they turn off and on really really really really really really really really really really really really fast. What was really sad is the fact that we had no quiz. I was so sad that I saw John Cena. It made me cry for hours. I was super hyped until I was told this drastic news. There images and videos below of the circuits we made and the blinking lights
